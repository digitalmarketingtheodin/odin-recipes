            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Pad gra pow is a traditional Thai dish that is very popular both in Thailand and around the world.
                    It is my families personal favorite recipe, and the version we like best involves frying ground pork in 
                    garlic, chilis, and basil.

                    When purchased from a street vendor or restuarant in thailand it is common for it to be served with a 
                    friedegg on top - which we do by filling a wok with oil, heating it to frying temperature and cracking an
                    egg right into it.
